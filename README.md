This isn't mine, I make no claims to it. This is Cisco Incident Response - CIR released by Recurity Labs in 2012.

It doesn't appear that this code is hosted anywhere else, but thankfully archive.org cached the files themselves. This is a mirror just to preserve it from further link rot.

It was released under GPLv3, which is the license maintained here.
